Project Progress : ![10%](https://progress-bar.dev/10/?title=done)

This challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country
data and display it like in the designs.

This challenge is built by Vue CLI

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SASS
- Vue

This challenge is responsive in all devices and I don't use any framework.

Users can:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country (or part of its name) using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode and the value stored in local storage
